//these are sql statements that once the database is set up can be used to query it

//ID 12

//NOTE - the "{TASKS}" needs to be replaced with the name of the table, i just used TASKS as a placeholder

SELECT * FROM {TASKS} ORDER BY DATE ASC
SELECT * FROM {TASKS} ORDER BY DATE DESC

SELECT * FROM {TASKS} ORDER BY TYPE ASC
SELECT * FROM {TASKS} ORDER BY TYPE DESC

SELECT * FROM {TASKS} ORDER BY STATUS ASC
SELECT * FROM {TASKS} ORDER BY STATUS DESC

SELECT * FROM {TASKS} ORDER BY DISTANCE ASC
SELECT * FROM {TASKS} ORDER BY DISTANCE DESC

//it doesnt matter whether 1 is complete or incomplete here
SELECT * FROM {TASKS} WHERE STATUS = 1
SELECT * FROM {TASKS} WHERE STATUS = 0


Filters involving dates could be added too if necessary, this page is helpful https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_date_time.htm

//select if the date of the task if less than 1 month

//strftime('%s','now') returns the current unix time (seconds since jan 1 1970)
//DATE means the date that the problem was submitted
//if the number of seconds from 1970 to now - 2629800 (the number of seconds in a month) - the number of seconds from 1970 to the DATE of the issue is greater than 0 (less than a month difference between them) then display it
SELECT * FROM {TASKS} WHERE strftime('%s', 'now', '-1 months') - strftime('%s', DATE); > 0

//we could format this string on the server side and then query the database with it instead of having separate strings for each time frame
//the time frames can be days, months, years
SELECT * FROM {TASKS} WHERE strftime('%s', 'now', '-{NUMBER OF TIME FRAMES E.G. DAYS} {TIME FRAME}') - strftime('%s', DATE); > 0

so for all tasks from the last 6 months we format the above string to be as such 
SELECT * FROM {TASKS} WHERE strftime('%s', 'now', '-6 months') - strftime('%s', DATE); > 0


base case for filtering (no filtering)
SELECT * FROM {TASKS}

Each filter needs to add an extra part to the query string e.g
if filtering is used, format this string
SELECT * FROM {TASKS} WHERE

e.g.
SELECT * FROM {TASKS} WHERE strftime('%s', 'now', '-1 months') - strftime('%s', DATE); > 0

and for the number of filters - 1we add an AND to the end e.g. if we want to select all the things solved from the past month we use 
SELECT * FROM {TASKS} WHERE strftime('%s', 'now', '-1 months') - strftime('%s', DATE); > 0 AND STATUS = 1
